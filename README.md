# Open Duelyst Assets

This repository pulls out the 2D image assets from [OpenDuelyst][1] for ease of
use. The `plist` files containing the frame information have been converted into
`json`.

The Python script used to generate the repository can be found in
[scripts/extract_assets.py][2]. The files are copied from the "app/resources"
directory which contains the compressed assets. The original assets can be found
under "app/original_resources".
